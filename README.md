# Mathematical-Modeling-Sage-Math-Sample-Code
Sample codes for demonstration and comparision between different scientific computing lanuages. This repository serves another collection of Sage Math sample codes for Meerschaeart's Mathematical Modeling (4 th ed. ) https://www.stt.msu.edu/users/mcubed/modeling.html In remembrance of Prof. Meerschaeart https://www.stt.msu.edu/users/mcubed/index.html And many thanks for his suggestions on making the plots. This repository is also different from the package I developed for quick viewing and modeling, linked on the author's website which is listed https://github.com/HaoLi111/rMathModeling
